# Now `go build` should work. It will first pull all of the go packages. Maybe it will complain about
# pkg-config not finding portaudio-2.0, in which case you have to point some environment variable somewhere,
# but that stopped happening to me the first time after installing portaudio.
#
# If it complains to you about having to `go get` something just do it, but I think go build does it for you now.
#
# Also when bot runs it may vomit some weird ALSA errors and warnings but it doesn't stop it from runnning
# and playing audio so I guess ignore that


# install spotifyd, just follow https://spotifyd.github.io/spotifyd/installation/Ubuntu.html

# SPOTIFY API
